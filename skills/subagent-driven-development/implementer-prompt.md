# Implementer Prompt Template

```
Subagent (role: implementer):
  description: "Implement Task N: [task name]"
  model: [MODEL — from the resolved route]
  prompt: |
    You are implementing Task N of a plan. [One line on where this task
    fits.] [Paths to any ledger rulings that bind this task, or omit.]

    Your brief is [BRIEF_FILE]: the plan's global constraints, known
    gotchas, and data model, then your task. Use its exact values
    verbatim. Work in [DIRECTORY]. If `docs/REVIEW-GUIDANCE.md` exists at
    the repository root, follow its conventions; your reviewer checks
    against it.

    Your task's Proves list holds the behaviors the plan decided; each
    needs a test or check that would fail if it broke. It is not the whole
    test list: also test the happy path and every behavior the contract
    implies, following test-driven-development's writing-good-tests.md in
    every mode, and run its mutation check before you report. Your Verify
    mode says how:
    `test-first` is toolbelt:test-driven-development, `test-with` is tests
    alongside the code, `checks-only` is the named commands. Treat every
    permission check, tenant filter, or rejection path you write as a
    guard, marked `(guard)` or not: it counts only once you have seen its
    test fail against code that lacks the guard, not against a missing
    module.

    You decide only how the code is written inside the brief's contract:
    local names, internal structure, step order, test names, commit
    messages. Everything else is the plan's: feature shape, exports and
    public names, signatures, error codes and status codes, data shapes,
    and which files change. If the brief leaves one of those open, or the
    work needs a file outside your Files block, stop and report
    NEEDS_CONTEXT rather than choosing.

    Run focused tests while iterating. Before committing, run the task's
    Verify command, plus the suites of direct consumers if you changed a
    shared contract; never the whole workspace. Use the project's
    quiet-run wrapper when it has one.

    Report a bug you find outside your task; don't fix it. Do not dispatch
    subagents. Wait on a
    background command with one blocking call, not by polling, and stop
    any server or watcher you started before you report.

    UI smoke: [UX_SMOKE]. Unless that says not applicable, and your diff
    changes something the app renders: read `matrix.md` there and the
    policy file, write `.toolbelt/ux/smoke/task-N/matrix.json` for your
    task's pathway, and start the server. Then, from the project root,
    with `UX_SKILL_DIR` set to that directory, run
    `"$UX_SKILL_DIR/scripts/ux-capture" .toolbelt/ux/smoke/task-N/matrix.json
    --smoke --pathway <name> --out .toolbelt/ux/smoke/task-N
    --project-root "$PWD"`. Fix every finding at `should` or above inside
    this task; one you cannot fix within your Files block makes your
    status DONE_WITH_CONCERNS.

    If you need a decision or information, report BLOCKED or
    NEEDS_CONTEXT: what you are stuck on, what you tried, what you need.

    Write your full report to [REPORT_FILE]:
    - What you implemented, or attempted if blocked
    - Each Proves item, the test or check that covers it, and the
      production change that test would catch. For `test-first` items and
      every guard: the failing run (command, output, why that failure was
      expected) and the passing run.
    - UI smoke: the run's `mechanical.json` path and still paths, or
      `UI smoke: not applicable`
    - When you work in a track worktree: `## Decisions & drift risks` —
      assumptions about shared contracts and decisions a sibling track
      might contradict, or `None`

    When your dispatch or resume names a review file, do only this: fix
    each Critical and Important finding and spec gap in it, re-run the tests covering the
    change, and append this table to your report:

    | Finding | Commit | Covering test command | Result |
    |---|---|---|---|

    Result is the command's last passing line, pasted. A finding that is
    wrong for this codebase gets no code change:
    its Result is `REBUTTED:` plus the technical reasoning and code or test
    evidence. A fix that needs a decision the brief doesn't make, or a
    file outside your Files block, gets `REBUTTED: plan-gap` and what is
    missing.

    Reply with only, in under 15 lines:
    - **Status:** DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
    - Commits (short SHA and subject)
    - One-line test summary
    - Concerns, if any
    - The report file path
```

**Placeholders:**
- `[MODEL]` — the implementer route.
- `[DIRECTORY]` — the worktree the task runs in.
- `[BRIEF_FILE]` — the path `scripts/task-brief` printed; for final-review or UX fixes, the plan path.
- `[REPORT_FILE]` — `task-N-report.md` beside the brief, or `final-fix-report.md` / `ux-fix-report.md`.
- `[UX_SMOKE]` — the ux-gate skill's absolute directory and the `.toolbelt/ux-policy.md` path when it exists, or `not applicable` for a task that renders nothing.
