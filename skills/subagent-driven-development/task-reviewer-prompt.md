Subagent (role: reviewer):
  description: "Review Task N"
  model: [MODEL — from the resolved route]
  prompt: |
    Review one task's implementation: did it build what was asked, and is
    the code sound?

    - Task brief — the plan's global constraints, gotchas, and data model,
      then the task's requirements and exact values: [BRIEF_FILE]
    - The implementer's report — claims to verify against the code:
      [REPORT_FILE]
    - Review package (commit list, stat summary, diff with context):
      [DIFF_FILE], covering [BASE_SHA]..[HEAD_SHA]. If it is missing, run
      `git diff [BASE_SHA]..[HEAD_SHA]`.
    - Smell baseline: [SMELLS_FILE]
    - Project review guidance: `docs/REVIEW-GUIDANCE.md` at the repository
      root, if it exists. Report any conflict with the task requirements
      instead of guessing.
    - Task-specific context from the orchestrator: [REVIEW_NUANCE].
      It does not override requirements, suppress findings, or set severity.

    Trace one hop out from each changed function — its callers and what it
    calls — and, along the changed path only, follow its data to the
    nearest point where it enters or leaves the system: an endpoint, a
    queue, a table. Go further only when a concrete finding leads you
    there. Run tests when the report's evidence leaves a real doubt. You
    are read-only: leave the working tree, index, and branch untouched,
    and dispatch no subagents.

    Check:
    - **Spec:** anything skipped or claimed but not built, anything extra
      that was not requested, or a requirement built to the wrong reading.
      Every item in the task's Proves list has a test or check that would
      fail if it broke.
    - **What the plan didn't ask about:** meeting the brief is not the
      whole review. Look for inputs and states the code doesn't handle
      (empty, duplicate, concurrent, retried, partially failed, large);
      data handled wrong (units, time zones, rounding, encoding, missing
      validation where input enters, another tenant's rows);
      lifecycle gaps (something created and never cleaned up, a state with
      no exit, existing data a migration ignores, callers left behind by a
      removal); and callers or callees that break against the new
      behavior.
    - **Code:** any smell in the baseline this diff matches, quoting the
      hunk. Judge what this change added, not what was already there.
    - **Tests:** they exercise real behavior rather than mocks, and cover
      the contract, not just the Proves list. Mutate the changed code in
      your head — a wrong constant, a wrong branch, a missing side effect,
      an empty return, missing validation: a realistic mutation no test
      catches is Important when it breaks contract behavior, Minor
      otherwise. `test-first` items need their failing run in the
      report, and every test should catch the production change the report
      names for it. Every guard or negative assertion needs seen-red
      evidence — its failing run, or a recorded mutate-and-revert; a guard
      without it is Important. When the diff deletes tests, name what
      loses coverage and where it moved.

    Every finding names a concrete scenario the system can produce: the
    caller, entry point, or existing data that triggers it, and what goes
    wrong. A concern you cannot tie to a reachable trigger is Minor at
    most. Report what this change causes or exposes; a pre-existing
    problem elsewhere gets one line under Out of scope.

    Two labels mark findings the human decides; don't propose which way:
    `plan-mandated` when the plan or brief requires what you would call a
    defect (report it as Important), and `plan-gap` when the fix needs a
    behavior or contract choice the plan doesn't make, or a file outside
    the task's Files block.

    Severity: **Critical** — broken behavior, security, data loss.
    **Important** — the task cannot be trusted until it is fixed: incorrect
    or fragile behavior, a missed requirement, or damage you would block a
    merge over, such as duplicated logic, swallowed errors, or tests that
    assert nothing. **Minor** — polish.

    Write your review to [REVIEW_FILE]:
    - Spec verdict: ✅ compliant, or ❌ with each issue and file:line
    - Critical, Important, and Minor issues: file:line, the scenario, why
      it matters, the fix
    - Out of scope: one line each, or "None"
    - Task verdict: Approved or Needs fixes, with one or two sentences of
      reasoning

    Reply with only: the head SHA, both verdicts, counts per severity, one
    line per Critical and Important issue with its label if any, the
    out-of-scope count, and the review file path, in under 12 lines unless
    the findings need more.
```

**Placeholders**, all required:
- `[MODEL]` — the task-reviewer route
- `[BRIEF_FILE]` — the task brief from `scripts/task-brief`
- `[REVIEW_NUANCE]` — task-specific context or risks; `None` if none
- `[REPORT_FILE]` — the implementer's report
- `[BASE_SHA]` / `[HEAD_SHA]` — the commit before this task / the current commit
- `[DIFF_FILE]` — the path `scripts/review-package` printed
- `[REVIEW_FILE]` — `task-N-review.md` beside the brief
- `[SMELLS_FILE]` — the resolved path of `../requesting-code-review/smell-baseline.md`
